There’s a lemondrop monkey that whistles and sings
And marshmallow chickens with sugary wings.
Eating wee gumdrop worms that the mother hen brings.
In the Land Where the Taffy Birds Grow.

The rivers are gold-colored honey so sweet,
And a licorice dog, you are certain to meet.
With a lollipop pig that has caramel feet,
In the Land Where the Taffy Birds Grow.

There’s a chocolate mouse and a peppermint cat,
And a sugarplum cow in a cocoanut hat.
Baking cinnamon cookies, so puffy and fat.
In the Land Where the Taffy Birds Grow.

You’ll see round doughnut stars playing peek-a-boo.
And a big yellow moon smiling at you,
(A gingerbread man told me these things were true)
In the Land Where the Taffy Birds Grow.
